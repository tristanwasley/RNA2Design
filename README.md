# RNA2Design (BioE 134 Final Project, December 2017)
User interface for finding the most optimally folding RNA sequence, given a drawn secondary structure.
This project stems from the current inablity to simply read DNA sequences and be able to understand what
they do. There is a similar problem with correlating structure to sequence. The idea is to create a 
platform with-in which Bioengineers can design biologically-sound RNA secondary structures, knowing only
what shape or functionality they need.

To run RNA2Design, either:

    1. ) Clone the repository and run drawdiag.java from an IDE like IntelliJ.
    
    or,
    
    2. ) Locate the RNA2Design.jar inside of the file labelled "out."
          a. ) Download to a convenient location on your computer and double click the file to run it.
  *Instructions on how to draw structures are provided in program.
    

Potential Areas of Improvement:

  1. ) Only handles small RNA structures at the moment.
  2. ) Find a better-coded Nussinov algorithm to handle prediction of a sequence's structure.
  3. ) Add more graphics to the drawing function.
  4. ) Decrease the amount of clicks one needs to do to make a structure.
  5. ) Ability to add "reactive" sites to specific parts of the RNA structure.
  
      a. ) i.e. Hammerhead Ribozyme, RNA logic circuit
  6. )
